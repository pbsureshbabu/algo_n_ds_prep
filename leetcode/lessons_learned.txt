// #41: First missing positive integer
// 1. use the header climits for INT_MAX and INT_MIN
// 2. check the input parameters and validity
// 3. also check the values in the intermediate code where you will 
//    think that the code before has changed from the initial value.
// 4. vector stl
// 5. while updating the lookup table, use the arr value instead of indexes
//    as it was intended to be.


// #42: Trapping rain water
// 1. review the vector/array boundaries, whether anyelement outside is being accessed.
// 2. think about which one to have, whether max or -2 or 0 or min of -2 or 0.
// 3. go through some test cases.


// Misc
// 1. be careful w/ stl .size(). Have the parenthesis.
// 2. also be careful w/ converting character into a lut
// 3. characters can be added to the string container by + operator like 
//    string s1;
//    s1+='c';
